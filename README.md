Final written project topic: Economic shifts in Calgary
**Introduction**
Unemployment rate is an important indicator of measuring the economic health of Calgary. In 1997, statistics showed that Calgary with a 6.4 percent unemployment rate, was the lowest of the largest 25 metropolitan areas in Canada which made Calgary economy look appealing, thereby attracting people to come into the province, (“Where the Jobs Are, 1997). However, in recent times, Alberta now has a higher unemployment rate higher than the rest of the country at 7.5 percent while the others average at 6.8 percent (Stolte, 2024). Understanding these unemployment rates and trends are essential for developing effective policies and promoting economic resilience. Calgary is a city known for its close ties to the oil industry hence changes in employment rates within the sector could greatly affect unemployment rates in the city. For instance, due to the covid pandemic, there was a squeeze in the Canadian crude-oil prices. Canadian finance minister, warned local businesses about how the epidemic will have a significant impact on the energy sector putting more pressure on the city's struggling economy (Franson, 2020).
Data Sets
Unemployment rates, Population and Industries data sets were used.
**Guiding quesstion** 
1. How does Calgary's unemployment rate compare to the overall rate of Alberta and Canada. Understanding Calgary's unemployment rate relative to Alberta and Canada can reveal whether Calgary faces unique economic challenges or benefits that differ from broader trends.

   When the unemployment figures are compared, it is apparent that unemployment rates in Calgary, Alberta, and Canada do follow each other. That convergence accounts for the fact that local Alberta labor market conditions in Calgary and statewide conditions are dictated by national trends. Whenever something happens at the national level—whether due to monetary policy changes, international market pressures, or some other factor—Calgary and Alberta move with it, demonstrating regional and national economy interdependence
2. What is the trend in Calgary's total unemployment rate on a month-to-month basis and a year-to-year basis?

   The tight relationship between the unemployment rate and the change on a year-over-year basis is a reflection that longer-term, cumulative effects of economic dislocation are better reflected on an annual basis. In the periods when the unemployment rate spikes, the year-over-year change is a significant indicator of the degree of economic dislocation.
